# Biz Directory API - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start the API
```bash
bash start.sh
```
The API will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 2: Create Sample Data
```bash
python seed_data.py
```
This creates test accounts and sample businesses/reviews.

### Step 3: Test the API
```bash
bash test_api.sh
```
Runs automated tests to verify everything works.

## 📝 Test Accounts

After running the seed script:

**Admin Account**
- Email: `admin@bizdirectory.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Can: Create, update, delete any business or review

**Regular User Account**
- Email: `john@example.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Can: Create businesses, create/edit own reviews

## 🧪 Testing with Postman

### Import Collection
1. Open Postman
2. Import `postman_collection.json`
3. Create environment with variables:
   - `base_url`: `http://localhost:5000`
   - `token`: (will be set automatically after login)

### Test Flow
1. **Login as Admin** → Saves token automatically
2. **Get All Businesses** → See paginated list
3. **Search Businesses** → Try `?city=New York`
4. **Create Business** → Add new business
5. **Add Review** → Rate a business
6. **Update Business** (Admin only) → Modify business
7. **Delete Business** (Admin only) → Remove business

## 📦 Assignment Submission

### Export Data
```bash
python export_data.py
```
Creates JSON files in `exports/` directory:
- `users.json`
- `businesses.json`
- `reviews.json`

### Create Submission ZIPs

**Source Code ZIP:**
```bash
zip -r biz-directory-source.zip \
  app.py config.py routes/ utils/ \
  start.sh seed_data.py README.md \
  .gitignore pyproject.toml
```

**MongoDB Data ZIP:**
```bash
cd exports
zip ../biz-directory-mongodb.zip *.json
cd ..
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**API not responding?**
```bash
# Check if it's running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Restart the workflow from Replit UI
# Or run: bash start.sh
```

**No data in database?**
```bash
# Seed sample data
python seed_data.py
```

**Want to reset everything?**
```bash
# Delete all data and re-seed
python seed_data.py  # This clears existing data first
```

**Need fresh exports?**
```bash
# Export current database state
python export_data.py
```
